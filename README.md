<h1 align = "center">👋 Hi there! I'm Harsh Sharma</h1><br>

A curious and self- driven Computer Engineering student, currently exploring the world of data analysis and solving problem using code.

I've always believed that learning by doing is the best way to grow — and that’s exactly what I’m doing. I love working on small projects that challenge me to think deeper and push my skills further.

## 👨‍💻 What I’m Learning:
- Python for data wrangling and automation
- SQL for handling and querying structured data
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Basic HTML & CSS for frontend work

## 📊 My Projects So Far:
- **[Netflix Data Analysis](https://github.com/Harsh-Sharma-DA/Project/tree/main/Data_Analytics/Netflix_Data_Analytics):**  
  A beginner-friendly data exploration project using the Netflix dataset. This helped me understand data cleaning, filtering, and deriving insights from real-world data.

- **[Portfolio Website](https://github.com/Harsh-Sharma-DA/Project/tree/main/My%20Portfolio):**

  I'm also building my personal portfolio to showcase my journey and projects in one place (deplyoing soon 🚀).

## 📍 A Bit More About Me:
- 📍 Based in Delhi, India  
- 🧠 Self-taught and passionate about learning hands-on  
- 🎯 Currently looking for an *in-office internship in Delhi NCR* to grow with real-world experience  
- 📚 Also brushing up on topics I’ve learned earlier to stay sharp
